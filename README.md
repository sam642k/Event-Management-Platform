# Virtual Event Management Platform

**(Under Development)**

This project is a comprehensive solution for managing virtual events, enabling organizers to create, manage, and monetize events, while offering a seamless experience for attendees. The platform supports real-time features like live streaming, chat, and audience engagement tools.

### **Microservices Architecture**
The platform follows a **microservices architecture**, where different parts of the application (such as user management, event creation, and ticketing) are handled by separate services. This ensures scalability, flexibility, and better isolation of features. Each service is designed to handle a specific function and can be scaled independently based on load.

### **Cloud Deployment**
The application is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated using **Kubernetes**, ensuring that it can be easily deployed to a cloud platform like **AWS**. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** or **ECS (Elastic Container Service)** will be used to manage the deployment, ensuring that the platform is scalable, highly available, and secure. **Jenkins** will be used for automating the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for continuous integration, testing, and deployment of new features and updates.
